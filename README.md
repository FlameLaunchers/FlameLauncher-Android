## 1. What it does

This is **Java Edition**, not Bedrock. Join the servers your PC friends use, run the mods
they run. A real OpenJDK boots inside the app process — this is not an emulator.

### Versions and mods

| | |
|---|---|
| **Vanilla** | Alpha and Beta through the current release |
| **Mod loaders** | Fabric · Forge · NeoForge · Quilt |
| **Mods and modpacks** | Search and install straight from CurseForge and Modrinth |
| **Dependencies** | Required mods are **installed alongside automatically** |

The Java runtime is **chosen automatically** to match the version — 8 for 1.16 and below,
16 for 1.17, 17 through 1.20.4, 21 from 1.20.5, 25 for 26.x. Nothing to pick.

### Graphics

| Renderer | How | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **Zink** 🌋 | Vulkan → OpenGL (Mesa) | Modern GPUs, 1.17+ · **use this for shaders** |
| **Krypton** ⚛️ | OpenGL → GLES 3.x | Broad version coverage, built in |
| **GL4ES** 🕹️ | OpenGL → GLES 2.0 | Old versions (1.12 and below), devices Zink won't run on |
| **MobileGlues** 🚀 | OpenGL 4.x → GLES 3.2 | Fastest for shaders · used by 26.3's OpenGL path |

If Zink fails it steps down on its own: **Freedreno (Adreno) → Panfrost (Mali) → GL4ES**.
You can also import a **custom Vulkan driver** (Turnip and similar) as a zip, in the
AdrenoTools format.

Shaders run on **Iris** — reflections, shadows, coloured light.

### Controls

- **On-screen buttons** — you place and size them yourself
- **Hardware keyboard** — picked up as soon as it connects
- **Mouse** — Pointer Capture, so looking around isn't bounded by the screen edge.
  Menus switch to an absolute cursor automatically; the wheel is the hotbar
- **Gamepad** — sticks and triggers included

### Multiplayer

Ordinary servers, plus **Online LAN** for playing with a friend without renting a server:
open a room, share the code, they join with it.

### Account

Microsoft sign-in only. **No game files ship with the app** — you download them from
Mojang's own servers with your own account.

## 2. Running it

### What you need

| | |
|---|---|
| **Android 8.0 or later** | API 26 |
| **arm64-v8a** | Essentially any device from 2017 onward. 32-bit is **not supported** |
| **4 GB free** | App, game and a Java runtime |
| **4 GB RAM recommended** | Modpacks are a stretch below 3 GB |
| **A paid account** | Minecraft Java Edition |

> Unlike iOS, **no JIT setup is needed.** Android doesn't stop apps from generating code at
> runtime, so you install and go.

### 2-1. Install

1. Grab the latest APK from [Releases](https://github.com/FlameLaunchers/FlameLauncher-Android/releases)
2. Android asks you to allow installs from unknown sources — allow it
3. Grant storage permission on first launch

### 2-2. First run

1. **Sign in** — avatar at the top → Microsoft account
2. **Pick a version** — left menu → the release tab
3. **Pick a loader** — vanilla, Fabric, Forge or NeoForge
4. **Download** — game files and a Java runtime; first time only, 5–15 minutes
5. **Play** — select it under the installed tab and press play

### 2-3. Turning on shaders

1. Install **Fabric** on the instance
2. Install **Iris Shaders** from the modpack browser — dependencies come along
3. Switch the renderer to **Zink**
4. In game: `Options → Video Settings → Shader Packs`

Heavy packs are a lot to ask of a phone. Start light — Complementary, or BSL on low.

### 2-4. Controls

The keyboard editor lets you place and resize the on-screen buttons. Hardware keyboards,
mice and gamepads are picked up the moment they connect — nothing to configure.

### 2-5. When it doesn't work

| Symptom | What to check |
|---|---|
| Installs, then closes immediately | Confirm the device is **arm64-v8a**. 32-bit is unsupported |
| Crashes mid-game | Out of RAM. **Lower the heap allocation** in options — counter-intuitive, but a smaller Java heap leaves room for textures. Lower the render distance too |
| A modpack won't start | With many mods the first boot takes minutes. If it still fails, try another renderer; Zink and GL4ES differ in what they tolerate |
| Shaders render garbage | Switch to **Zink**. GL4ES cannot drive shaders properly |
| A shader pack switches itself off (Mali GPUs) | Packs that use `noperspective` — Complementary and its forks — can't compile on Mali, so Iris falls back to no shaders. Turn the pack off to skip the attempt and load faster |

## 3. Licence

**[AGPL-3.0](LICENSE)**, by obligation rather than preference.

A combined work takes the **strongest copyleft** it contains, and the Terracotta bundled
here is AGPL-3.0.

| Component | Licence | How it is used |
|---|---|---|
| **Terracotta** | **AGPL-3.0** | `libterracotta.so` + JNI binding (Online LAN) |
| PojavLauncher core | GPL-3.0 | JNI / EGL / OSMesa bridges, LWJGL and exec hooks, AWT stubs |
| ZalithLauncher 2 | GPL-3.0 | Launch flow (NeoForge classpath, Forge processors, GLFW 3.4 stubs) |
| EasyTier | LGPL-3.0 | inside Terracotta |
| libadrenotools | BSD-2-Clause | custom Vulkan driver loading |
| LWJGL (Pojav-patched) | BSD-3-Clause | `lwjgl3/` |
| OpenJDK (Temurin) | GPL-2.0 + Classpath Exception | bundled JRE |

GPL-3.0 code may be combined into an AGPL-3.0 work — GPLv3 section 13 permits exactly this
— and the result must be distributed under AGPL-3.0.

> **Correction to earlier releases.** The `LICENSE` file used to contain LGPL-3.0, and this
> project's own code was listed as "no declared license". Both were wrong: the tree already
> contained GPL-3.0 (PojavLauncher) and AGPL-3.0 (Terracotta), so LGPL-3.0 was weaker than
> the combination allowed, and leaving the project's own code undeclared left the whole work
> ambiguous.

Custom Vulkan drivers (Turnip and similar) are **not distributed by this project.** Get
them from a source you trust — official Mesa, K11MCH1/AdrenoToolsDrivers — and import them
yourself.

See [NOTICE](NOTICE) for the details.
